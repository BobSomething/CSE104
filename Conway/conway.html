            <strong>Game of life (Life)</strong> - is a cellular automaton devised by John Horton Conway.<br>

            Every cell interacts with all its eight neighbours. At each step in time we have:

            <ol>
                <li>Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbors dies, as if by underpopulation.</li>
                <li>Any live cell with two or three live neighbors lives on to the next generation.</li>
                <li>Any live cell with more than three live neighbors dies, as if by overpopulation.</li>
                <li>Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.</li>
            </ol>

            By interacting with the cells, you can set their state: black - alive; white - dead.<br>
            You can also customize the grid with any length and height. <br>
            Also you can pick a type of board on which the cells will live on. <br>
            You can also adjust the speed of generating a new state. <br>

            If you are ready with the initial state of the board, click on the START button, to stop the game
            click on the END button. We recommend to try one of the spaceships (found on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life">Reference</a>).
            Have fun!<br>
